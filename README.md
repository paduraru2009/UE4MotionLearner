# UE4MotionLearner

## Scope:
The purpose of this UE4 plugin is to capture motion data from character animations and dump data on disk.

## What is able todo:
* Record Characters motion - the skeletal animation SQT for each bone, character and frame
* Record RGB and depth camera images from fixed / mobile camera that you set in the scene.

## How to use:


### Step 0: Clone the repository inside YourProject/Plugins folder, reopen the project and you have a check to activate it.

### Step 1
Grab the MotionLearner actor and drag it to your scene, like in the figure below: ![](https://github.com/paduraru2009/UE4MotionLearner/blob/master/Resources/Help_addComponent.PNG).

### Step 2:
Configure the actor's properties if you wish to modify the camera resolution, frame rate, output paths, etc.
Unless you customize things on your own you should:
* name your characters as capchar_0, capchar_1, .... capchar_N 
* name your cameras as capture_0, capture_1, .... capture_N
One important step is to force the fixed frame rate in the the ProjectSettings to have a fixed frame. 
For example if you want 30 fps set it is an in the figure below: ![](https://github.com/paduraru2009/UE4MotionLearner/blob/master/Resources/Help_fixedFrame.PNG).

### Step 3:
Hit play/start game, do whatever you want in your scene, then stop. You will see output like in the figure below: ![](https://github.com/paduraru2009/UE4MotionLearner/blob/master/Resources/Help_foldersExp.PNG).

Output definition:
* motiondata.bin : contains the frames data, SQT for each bone and frame in world space, captured for all characters. Check void AMotionLearnerActor::saveCharactersMotionData() in AMotionLearnerActor.cpp to understand the binary format used.
* capchar_X_bonesmap.json : json for each character containing the mapping, the index in the data above to the bone name.
* Cam_X_FY_rgb.png for each camera index X and frame Y, contains the RGB from the cameras that you set point of view
* Cam_X_FY_depth.png, save as above, but contains the depth data. **Note**: You can't open it, it is a binary file in format: ResolutionHeightxResolutionWidthx1FLOAT, where the float contains for each pixel the distance from camera to the depth on that projected pixel in world space, centimers.
